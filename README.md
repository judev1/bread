# WARNING!
- For the foreseeable future all dependencies must be written in python, as of yet bread does not support any dependencies written in bread
 - The breadinstaller is only installable on windows, however, the compiler and interpreter are written in python and so can be used anywhere with a bit of modification

# How to install/use
 - Download the [breadinstaller](https://github.com/judev1/bread/blob/main/breadinstaller.exe?raw=true), but make sure not to download the entire repo
 - Run the breadinstaller and follow the setup wizard, bread has now been installed onto your system
 - You can run your bread code as simply as typing into cmd: `bread run example.brr` (all bread files **must** end with .brr)
 - You can also compile your bread code into python, or vice versa with: `bread compile example.brr` or `bread compile example.py`

# Examples
The Hello World program
```python
numnums("Hello World")
```
The Cat program
```python
numnums(gimme())
```
